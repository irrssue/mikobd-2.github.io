        <p>Beside you, I saw wonderful memories,

          Behind the story: While we were discussing artists we like on the Ground floor of Auston, I mentioned that I'm a fan of Keshi. You responded by saying that you also enjoy his songs. So, I asked you which one is your favorite, and you replied, "Beside You."
        </p>
        <p>Everyday I'm smiling way more, I'm so happy <span class="color-text">you</span>'re here
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Behind the story: Coincidentally, the day after we talked about Keshi's songs, that very night, Jeremy Zucker released a song that I've been listening to ever since. I was so excited to show it to you.
