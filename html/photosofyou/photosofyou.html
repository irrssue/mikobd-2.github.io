      Not gonna lie, when I first met you, I really wanted to ask, why the hell do you wear a mask all the time? Like, could you please put it off at least when you're with me? ðŸ¥¹ I really wished I could have seen your smile. But no worries, I'll see tons of them in the future because we will be best friends, forever. Psssss, bahahaa, between us I can use the word "forever."
