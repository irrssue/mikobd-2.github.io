        <p>You know, I really love hanging out with you. I genuinely cherish those moments, finding warmth and comfort in your company. Remember our first visit there? We talked for hours until I realized I was sharing a bit too much, and time just flew by with laughter🤣<br>
          I want to explore new places alongside you. Road trips and global adventures, someday. Thinking of you, you're the best friend for life in my thoughts. And yes, not a day passes without the excitement of meeting you. <br>
          I'm also eager to meet your parents, and let's plan some trips before my journey to America.
